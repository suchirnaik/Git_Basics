Q1. What is one benefit of using version control?
    Version control helps the users track all commits which were made in order. This helps users understand the updates which were made to the application
Q2. What is something new you learned about Git this week?
    I learned the difference between forking and cloning. Cloning helps replicate the repository on the local while forking helps replicate the repository on the server like github.com.
